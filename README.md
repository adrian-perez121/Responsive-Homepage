# Overall Thoughts

This project wasn't that bad. It was interesting to learning how to create a responsive website in html/css. It was also a really big pain just making the heading.
Overall, I really liked this project and I felt like learned more about how to make a website look good on different devices (this was one of my previous weaknesses).
